# oneshot-prompts-cursor
The mission of this project is to design prompts that are verifiably tested to "One-shot" feature integrations for cursor, windsurf, cline coding IDE's etc
This means that a new nextjs project for example with the copy pasted prompt and a simple additional config like pasting in a .env key will get the feature or integration working.


Let's build software better, faster together.
